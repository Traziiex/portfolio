# portfolio - Noah Blanchard
learning new stuff by creating my own portfolio for the future !

## Visit the portfolio on this link :
https://traziiex.github.io/portfolio/

## What will this website be ?
I will work on this website and hope to make it a functional portfolio where I'll be able to share my work and present myself.
By creating the portfolio, I want to acquire pure vanilla JavaScript front-end skills.
